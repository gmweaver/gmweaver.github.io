The sample included over 5,000 children from the Children's Health Study in California, followed during 1993-2014. HW children were 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24, 1.73) times more likely to live close (50% NA ancestry were 40% more likely to live close to a freeway or to a major nonfreeway road, compared with those with ≤50% NA ancestry. The association of TRP with ever having been diagnosed by a doctor as having asthma differed between HW and NHW children (P 50% NA ancestry. Within this subgroup, those close to a major nonfreeway road were 2.16 (95% CI: 1.26, 3.69) times more likely to have ever reported asthma compared with those living further away. This paper provides evidence that HW children in southern California, especially those with greater NA ancestry, are more exposed to TRP and are potentially at greater risk for TRP-related respiratory health effects.","tags":[],"title":"Traffic-Related Pollutants: Exposure and Health Effects Among Hispanic Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Vega Yon","GM Weaver"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490295600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490295600,"objectID":"cb872a9c97dc2251a139dbcbb9451527","permalink":"/talk/intro-hpc-r/","publishdate":"2017-03-23T12:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/intro-hpc-r/","section":"talk","summary":"While the R programming language was not developed for High Performance Computing (think about the ‘for’ loops!), thanks to its alwaysthriving community of users, there are several ways in which R can be used to perform HPC. In this presentation, we will provide a general overview of HPC in R with a particular focus on multicore processing (i.e. no big data for now), and introduce some of the available tools for enhancing your R code. Furthermore, we'll include some examples using the 'parallel' package, the 'foreach'+'iterators' R packages, and Rcpp(Armadillo) + OpenMP.

The stored macro compiled facility is one such method that allows users to store a macro, along with the source code, to a location of their choice. To more effectively utilize the stored compiled macro facility, we developed a solution that enables a user to upload, delete, and search for macros generated by multiple users in a common directory. Along with presentation of this solution, we intend to highlight a number of coding techniques with uses beyond this particular example. Techniques include user management, automatic creation and deletion of files, regular expressions, use of PROC REPORT, and a number macro development techniques. Through the implementation of these macros, an organization can increase collaboration and code reuse without ever having to leave the SAS environment.","tags":[],"title":"Macros to Manage Your Macros?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
